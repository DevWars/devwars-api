## Running our test suite:

Go to the root of the repo

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

All of your tests should pass by default on your first run. We use SQLite so you won't need a database running while you develop.

If however, you want to run our entire stack, please refer to our repo [DevWars Stack](https://github.com/DevWars/devwars-stack)
